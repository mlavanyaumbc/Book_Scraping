My Web scraping project on Books to Scrape where I collected data on the top 20 books using Python and Beautiful Soup!

📚 Project Overview: My goal was to scrape data from an online bookstore to analyze book ratings, prices, and availability, uncovering popular trends and patterns in book purchasing.

💻 Tech Stack: Python, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and SQLite.
